Component Description:

- This description takes a prop from the home component
    - on the click of the ingredient button in the fridge, this component duplicates that button with the same information
    - it then adds the information to a new array
    - the information in this array is NOT logged in the database
    - the purpose of this extra search bar is to refine the search for users who have a lot of ingredients logged in their fridge
