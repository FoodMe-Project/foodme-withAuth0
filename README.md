#FOODME WEBAPP

Things to fix:

    - Find out how to navigate with the buttons i have on the sidebar
    - fix api loop
    - find out how to impliment gradient on fridge so recipes will start at the top and it will look nicer when scrolling
    - log the I.D. of the recipe api when favourite button is clicked
    - On click of ingredient button (not the 'x') when ingredient is in the "fridge", duplicates the button and adds it to a queue for a more refined search
